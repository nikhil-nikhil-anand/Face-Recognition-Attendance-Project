# Face-Recognition-Attendance-Project

Face recognition attendance system makes use of facial recognition technology to identify and 
verify a person and mark attendance automatically.

The model is build using g dlib’s state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning. 
The model has an accuracy of 98%.

The system can be defines as “system that uses a deep learning model to recognize students and 
grants them attendance while maintaining a database of their attendance.”

### Existing System
Calling by name: This is a common way of taking attendance in school and colleges.

Signing on a sheet of paper. This method is mainly used by colleges and universities.

Fingerprint: This method is mainly used in labs and room with confidential data.

RFID card: This method are usually used by universities and Offices.

### Disadvantage of existing system.
• Calling by name, Signing on a sheet of paper:

• Waste of time.15%-20% time is wasted in taking attendance in large classes.

• Proxys: 10%-30% of student get proxy.

• Distraction from class

• Fingerprint

• Waste of time: 10-15% of time is wasted in taking attendance in large classes.

• The accuracy and working of system is affected by skin conditions of people.

• There are health issues involved due to touching of single scanning sensor This 
has serious implications in pandemic situations such as COVID-19 etc.

• Cost and maintenance.

• RFID

• Proxys: 10%-30% of student get proxy.

• Waste of time: 10-15% of time is wasted in taking attendance in large classes.

• An RFID system can be hacked or bypassed

• More Expensive to Setup
